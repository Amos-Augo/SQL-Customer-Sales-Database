# SQL-Customer-Sales-Database
This script demonstrates SQL operations such as sorting with ORDER BY and filtering grouped results using GROUP BY and HAVING. It uses sample product and customer data to show how to count related records and display only those meeting specific conditions (e.g., customers owning more than two products).
